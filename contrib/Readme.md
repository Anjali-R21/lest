====================

This folder contains extensions to *lest*. These extensions are not part of *lest* itself because for example it uses non-standard behaviour, it  is considered to be for a too-specific use case, or it is considered not yet ripe for inclusion in *lest* and we first like to gain more experience with it.

Availabe extensions:
- [Expect abort assertions](lest_expect_abort/Readme.md) by Martin Moene.
This extension lets you assert assertions and other calls to `abort()`. 
It depends on non-standard behaviour.
